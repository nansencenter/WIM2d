0.7   # CFL number
0     # USE_ICE_VEL : 0 = approx ice group vel by water group vel
1     # DO_ATTEN    : 0 = just advect waves without attenuation
1     # DO_BREAKING : 0 = turn off breaking for testing
1     # STEADY      : 1 = Steady-state solution, top-up waves inside wave mask
1     # SCATMOD     : Scattering model: 0 = old way; 1 = scatter E isotropically
0     # REF_Hs_ICE  : 1 = in ice, give Hs for displacement of the ice; 0 = give Hs for displacement of the surrounding water
1     # OPT         : ice-water-land configuration
0     # DIAG1d      : do 1-d diagnostics (eg plot profile of Hs)
1     # DIAG1d_OPT  : options for 1-d diagnostics
0     # CHK_ATTEN   : check by running with old attenuation
