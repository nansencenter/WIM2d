# keep version number on 1st line
# change this if there are significant changes to structure of infile and/or code
# (will be a warning in code if version number there doesn't match this one)

# format of each line:
# [value]   # [variable name in code]   : [explanation]
# NB comments start with "#" 
# NB order of variables doesn't matter
# strings now accepted: when reading the file, we 1st try 'str2num' and if that fails it is left as a string
