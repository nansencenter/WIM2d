value # <variable name> : explanation
3     # infile_version_ : infile version number
0.7   # CFL             : CFL number (cg*dt/dx)
1     # nw              : number of frequencies
32    # ndir            : number of directions
1     # DIR_INIT        : incident wave spectrum (spreading/delta...)
24    # duration_hours  : length of simulation [h]
0     # USE_ICE_VEL     : 0 = approx ice group vel by water group vel
1     # DO_ATTEN        : 0 = just advect waves without attenuation
1     # DO_BREAKING     : 0 = turn off breaking for testing
1     # STEADY          : 1 = Steady-state solution, top-up waves inside wave mask
1     # SCATMOD         : Scattering model: 0 = old way; 1 = scatter E isotropically
2     # ADV_OPT         : 0, not periodic boundary conditions; 1, periodic in x,y; 2, periodic in y only
2     # ADV_DIM         : Dimension of advection (1/2) TODO: use this
0     # REF_Hs_ICE      : 1 = in ice, give Hs for displacement of the ice; 0 = give Hs for displacement of the surrounding water
1     # OPT             : ice-water-land configuration
0     # DIAG1d          : do 1-d diagnostics (eg plot profile of Hs)
1     # DIAG1d_OPT      : options for 1-d diagnostics
0     # CHK_ATTEN       : check by running with old attenuation
